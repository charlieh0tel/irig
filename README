IRIG-B (and WWV/H) timecode generator, based on tg2.c form NTP 4.3.91
(9c75327c3796ff59ac648478cd4da8b205bceb77).

Now portaudio enabled.   48 KHz sample rate works well. 

Tested on Ubuntu 21.10 and Raspbian 11.

TODO:
* Verify top of second is where it is supposed to be.
* Replace sin() call with lookup.
* Make output phase continuous.
* Make work with 44.1 KHz sample rate (but everythign seems to support 48 KHz).
